# My Vacation Survey

Website I made to showcase what I have learned these last two weeks. Used forms and Javascript to have the user fill out a survey that shows the user where they should go on vacation based on a few simple questions. (The 5th question is pointless but fun to answer!). Used Bootstrap and custom CSS to style. Made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
